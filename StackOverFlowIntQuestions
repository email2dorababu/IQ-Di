1. Rename the Part file to Custom Name - e.g part-r-0000 to be userdefinedName-r-0000.
A)The files are created by MR jobs generated by Pig. So we need to configure MR.
The property is   SET  mapreduce.output.basename 'custom-name';
in pig - pig -Dmapreduce.output.basename=my-outputfilename

2) merge the tuples sets
1,(1,2)
2,(2,3)

1,(b,c,b,c)
2,(c,d,c,d)  

into 1,(1,2,b,c,b,c)
2,(2,3,c,d,c,d)
A)A = LOAD 'dataA'  USING  PigStorage('\t') AS  (aid:long, atuple : tuple(af1:long, af2:long));
B = LOAD 'dataB'  USING  PigStorage('\t') AS  (bid:long, btuple : tuple(bf1:chararray, bf2:chararray, bf3:chararray, bf4:chararray));
C = JOIN A BY aid, B BY bid;
D = FOREACH C GENERATE aid AS id, FLATTEN(atuple) AS (af1:long, af2:long) , FLATTEN(btuple) AS (bf1:chararray, bf2:chararray, bf3:chararray, bf4:chararray);
E = FOREACH D GENERATE id, (af1..bf4);
DUMP E;
What if we have varied no of elements in tuples?
If we are aware of max number of elements in a row then we can either declare aliases for all of them or we can access elements using $ notation. 
For eg : if max number of elements in tuple 1 is 2 and in tuple 2 is 100 then while deriving the tuple for alias E in the sample set use ($1..$103)
